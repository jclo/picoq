# PicoQ

PicoQ is a template for writing micro UMD Javascript libraries that run both on Node.js and inside the browser.

PicoQ relies on [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com) for unitary testing. It relies on [Istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) for code coverage.

PicoQ uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration and [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io) to display test coverage.
